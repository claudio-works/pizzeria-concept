# Ippa Pizza - MENU REDISIGN

## OVERVIEW
This project is a complete redesign and development of the Ippa Pizza website, transforming their original static menu into a modern, responsive, and fully accessible online experience.

## THE PROBLEM
The original Ippa Pizza website featured a menu that was a single, static image. This presented several critical issues for the business and its customers:

- **Poor Accessibility**: Content within these third-party embeds is often difficult for screen readers to navigate, creating a barrier for visually impaired users.
- **Invisible to Seo**: Search engines cannot effectively read or index content that is locked inside an "iframe", making the entire menu invisible for search rankings.
- **Complex Update Process**: To change a menu item, the owner has to log into and manage a completely separate platform, rather than making a simple, direct edit to their own website.
- **Inconsistent User Experience**: The embedded menu didn't match the site's branding and could be slow to load, creating a disjointed and less professional experience for customers.

## MY SOLUTION
The goal was to build a new website from the ground up that solved these problems and provided a polished experience for all users. I started with a fresh concept in Figma and built it out with clean, semantic code.
